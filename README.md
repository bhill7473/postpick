# postpick

Post and Pick is a fantasy basketball application that uses an Express server for routing that attaches to a SQL back-end. The routing is done using the sequealize npm package. There is also a login page when the user first visits the site that I set up using a passport template. I plan on adding future implementations that allow a user to have their own unique records associated to them.
